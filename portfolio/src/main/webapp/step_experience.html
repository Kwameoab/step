      <p>
        I am happy with what I have made so far but I know it could be better.
        This website may not look too impressive but I happy with the progress I
        made within the week given to me to make this website. Before starting
        this website I knew nothing about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but within a
        week a was able to make this. I going to focus on getting a better
        understanding of CSS and JavaScript so I can turn the ideas I have for
        this webpage into a reality. A special thank you to Lyle Franklin and
        Ray Liu, for their patience and willingness to help me learn so much in
        all in one week.
